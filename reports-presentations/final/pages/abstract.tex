\chapter*{Abstract}
This work is a creation of valuable dependency parsing annotated data for
Nepali language. The created dataset is used to train along with other
languages to create a neural dependency parser based on graph based parsing.
The dataset created conforms to Universal Dependencies treebank and
will be a contribution for Nepali language. Training is done in the
state-of-the art graph based neural architecture that makes use of
multilingual BERT embeddings. Various experiments have been conducted
varying the source training languages and dataset sizes. In zero shot
case for Nepali language the UAS and LAS scores obtained are 59.52 and
47.47 respectively whereas for few shot case the scores are 80.73 and
72.67 respectively. This work presents a good enough baseline as well
as high quality data that can now be used for further research in the
direction of dependency parsing.
