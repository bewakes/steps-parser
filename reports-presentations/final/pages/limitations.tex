\chapter{Limitations}
The following are the current limitations of the parser:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[1.] It is heavily dependent on the POS Tagger. If the POS tagged results are poor, the parser has high chance of failing.
    \item[2.] The POS tagger has also been trained using limited data(just about 90,000 words). So, it has difficulties coping with new words.
    \item[3.] Some entities are represented by multiple words. For example,
        is very difficult by just looking at POS tags to discern if the
        consecutive \code{NN}s refer to single entity or two.
    \item[4.] Only simple sentences are parsed. The parser has yet to parse passive sentences, questions imperatives and other complex forms.
    \item[7.] The labels partially conform with the Universal Dependency labels. A
        mapping and transformation to UD labels needs to be done.
\end{itemize}
